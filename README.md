# locator
Geo Locator plugin for glFusion

Creates a "store locator"-type function where visitors can find locations
within a distance range from an origin location.

Also provides an autotag to allow inclusion of Google maps in stories and staticpages,
and an API for other plugins such as Evlist.

Requires the "lglib" plugin for some internal functions such as message handling.

## API Key
You will need to create an API key for Google Maps and enter it in the plugin configuration.
See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-an-api-key for information on getting an API key.
