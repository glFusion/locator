Geo Locator plugin for glFusion

Creates a "store locator"-type function where visitors can find locations
within a distance range from an origin location.

Also provides an autotag to allow inclusion of Google maps in stories and staticpages,
and an API for other plugins such as Evlist.

Requires the "lglib" plugin for some internal functions such as message handling.
